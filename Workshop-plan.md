# Worshop plan
---
Using mBlock for familiarizing with the programming concepts like loops and controlling sequence of actions and finally interact with real world through arduino.

## Class 1 - Introduction to Scratch

Students will be made familiar with scratch environment and few programming concepts - loops, sequential control, conditional.

* Lab1a - Make Mike and Rocket move and interact Roket
* Lab1b - Make Mike in Rocket fly in movie in auto mode
* Lab1c - Make Mike in Rocket fly in manual mode
* Lab1d - Travelling through Maze

## Class 2 - Making Scratch talk with Arduino

In this class, students will be made to create interact with Scratch through arduino

* Lab2a -
* Lab2b -
* Lab2c -



## Class 3 - Make a wired controlled car with Arduino in mBlock

Students will learn to create standalone application with Arduino using mBlock

* Lab3a -
* Lab3b -
* Lab3c -
